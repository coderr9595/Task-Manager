The task manager consists of three lists
=>Not Started
=>In Progress
=>Completed
The user can add the tasks in any of the list by clicking on '+ New' symbol.
If the user wants to make changes to the task like shift a task from 'in progress' to 'completed' he just needs to drag the task from one column to another.
